### Hola! 👋

- 🏝  My name is Misael Morales, I am from Venezuela, and I am currently a PhD student at The University of Texas at Austin. 
- 💻  My research is focused on the computational description of subsurface energy systems. I combine domain-specific knowledge with tools from machine learning, math and statistics, for accurate characterization and forecasting of complex dynamical systems in the subsurface. 
- 🎓  M.S. in Mathematics, B.S. in Applied Math and B.S. in Petroleum Engineering, all from the University of Tulsa.
- 🌐  My contacts: [Website](https://sites.google.com/view/misaelmmorales), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/misaelmmorales/), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wDcnKRUAAAAJ&hl=en)
